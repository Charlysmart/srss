            <p>At St. Raphael’s Secondary School, we are committed to providing a nurturing and academically excellent environment grounded in strong moral and spiritual values. Our admission process is designed to ensure that students who join us are ready to thrive in a dynamic learning community where discipline, academic rigor, and character formation are key priorities.</p>

            <u class="text-center text-main text-weight">Admission into Junior Secondary School 1 (JSS1)</u>

            <p>Admission into JSS1 is open to students who will be at least 7 years of age by September of the intended year of entry. The process begins with the St. Raphael’s Entrance Examination, which assesses a student’s readiness for the academic and moral expectations of secondary school life.</p>

            <p>The examination covers the following core subjects:</p>

            <p>English Language</p>

            <p>Mathematics</p>

            <p>General Studies</p>

            <p>These subjects are selected to test not only the student’s literacy and numeracy skills but also their general awareness and reasoning abilities. The exam is structured to reflect the standards of the Nigerian basic education curriculum and to evaluate how well each candidate has mastered the foundational knowledge required for success in junior secondary education.</p>

            <p>After the examination, selected candidates may be invited for an oral interview or brief interaction with the admissions panel. This gives us the opportunity to meet the candidate, understand their interests and strengths, and assess their alignment with the values and ethos of St. Raphael’s. Parents or guardians may also be required to attend an information session to understand the school's vision, policies, and expectations.</p>

            <u class="text-main text-weight">Transfer Admission into JSS2, JSS3, and SS1</u>
            <p>St. Raphael’s Secondary School also accepts transfer admissions into JSS2, JSS3, and Senior Secondary School 1 (SS1). Such admissions are subject to the availability of space in the desired class and a candidate’s performance in the Transfer Examination.</p>

            <p>The Transfer Examination is designed to evaluate a student's grasp of key subjects at their current level of education, ensuring that they can successfully integrate into the school’s academic structure. We take into account the student’s academic records from their previous school, performance in our entrance test, and sometimes an informal interview to assess adaptability and behavior.</p>

            <p>At St. Raphael’s, we understand that choosing the right school is a significant decision for every family. Our admission process is not just about selecting students; it’s about welcoming young minds into a community that values discipline, excellence, faith, and integrity. We are dedicated to shaping future scholars, principled leaders, and compassionate citizens.</p>
